<sub> Hi lol please don't be here right now I'm just starting and don't quite understand what I'm doing yet</sub>

My first ever after effects script/pseudo-effect. I don't even have the expression done yet though so this is gonna be a nothing burger until I at least get that up.

ALEEERTTT I am testing this on After Effects 2025 (25.1). This may not work on significantly older versions of AE.
Only works with the standard english alphabet. 

Not using Pseudo Effect Maker because I am insane, need a project, and do not want to spend money

# Installation
Still trying to figure out how exactly I'm supposed to share pseudo-effects. Not even sure if I'll really need to make this a script for installation, or if I can just save it as a preset. In the meantime, though, this is how we're working

1. Paste excerpt.xml into your PresetEffects.xml file just above the "</Effects>" at the very bottom of the file.
    PresetEffects.xml Location (Windows): Program Files > Adobe > After Effects (Version) > Support Files
    PresetEffects.xml Location (Mac): Apps > After Effects > Right-click After Effects.app > “Show Contents” > Contents > Resources
2. Download open.jsx (this will be used to apply the pseudo effect.) 
2. Restart After Effects (if it's open.)
3. In After Effects, select the layer you'd like the effect to be applied to.
4. Still in AE, navigate to File > Scripts > Run Script File, and run open.jsx. 

This will not do anything at all though because I have not linked the expression. xoxo.
